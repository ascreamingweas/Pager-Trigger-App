Pager-Trigger-App
=================

This was based on a project that I did at WTI. This computer app (written in C#) is an interface to connect to a radio/pager (serial connection) and send a repeating signal based on the set interval.


Also, these folders contain solution files since I used Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 for all of this.
